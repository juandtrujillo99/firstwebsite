# firstwebsite
Some years ago (2017) I made my first pure HTML project
It was for the first class in introduction to html, and this makes me feel good because I think that could be worse, anyway, if you watch my currently projects are too much better than this one but I know that I need to practice day by day.

I accept your comments and I hope that you share with me your first projects.
